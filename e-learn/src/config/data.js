      "CSS is the stylesheet language that every web developer must know. It allows us to make web pages more appealing to the user. A web page without CSS is like a human without clothes. CSS has a lot of cool features that allow us to create amazing experiences on the web. By using this stylesheet language, you can make web pages beautiful and responsive on all devices. You can also create good-looking layouts with the power of flexbox and grid.",

      "One of the reasons I like using pandas instead of Excel for data analysis is that it is easier to avoid certain types of copy-paste Excel errors. As great as pandas is, there is still plenty of opportunity to make errors with pandas code. This article discusses a subtle issue with pandas groupby code that can lead to big errors if you’re not careful. I’m writing this because I have happened upon this in the past but it still bit me big time just recently. I hope this article can help a few of you avoid this mistake.",

      "The AT&T Unix v6 shell from 1973, at least as found in PWB/UNIX from 1977, would fail to run test commands whose left-hand side matched a unary operator. This must have been immediately obvious to anyone who tried to check for command line parameters. This was fixed in the AT&T Unix v7 Bourne shell builtin in 1979. However, test and [ were also available as separate executables, and appear to have retained a variant of the buggy behavior:",

      "With the advent of AI and machine learning, organizations are maturing their data-analytics strategies. They are unlocking dark data, creating knowledge graphs specific to their needs, and generating real business insights, such as next best action recommendations. As is often said, data is the foundation for AI. In our work with leading enterprises around the world, we've learned that harvesting that data foundation requires a few key competencies – and talent is a critical one to get right. Enterprises need to have the right people – ones who can innovate business models on the back of data insights and set up a data strategy and infrastructure. Moreover, the right people can discover, wrangle, model, and contextualize data and insights.",

      "Is it worthwhile to learn SQL? Or will a language that’s over 40 years old soon be outdated? Have relational databases been eclipsed by the advent of other database solutions like NoSQL? In this article, we answer these questions. Do you need to upgrade your IT skills? What should you learn first? The choice is daunting. If you're looking to the future, you obviously want to invest your time in something that's still widely used and will continue to be in the years to come.      Should you learn SQL? SQL is relatively easy to master and has been said to be a good starting point. But some people are questioning whether this is still the case. I've heard people ask: This technology is over 50 years old. Isn't there something better? Isn't NoSQL the trend of the future? In a world of constantly changing technologies, it’s logical to think that something that’s been an IT standard for half a century should already have its successors. Many solutions tried to threaten the dominance of SQL, such as XML databases.",
